# DarwinSport
Distributed platform for harnessing genetic programming to evolve simulated 2D soccer players.

## Use
- This program has two primary uses:
  - (Realtime) Graphical display of human developed or gp developed soccer teams
  - Distributed testing cluster node for genetically evolving players
  - Run ``` lein run <mode> ``` where mode is instance number or ``` -demo ```
  - Standalone jar: ``` java -jar darwinsport-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar <mode> ```

## Notes
- This program is meant as a soccer development testing node for Darwin, the work of Jack Hay and Nate Symer.
- Requires Java (recent stable version)
- This repo is used for creating compute node images that are compatible with darwin running in a distributed setup
